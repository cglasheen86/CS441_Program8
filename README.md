Final Project: Role Playing Game

For my final project, I will be making a 2D top-down role playing game, similar to the old Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games. In this project, I hope to include random enemy encounters, non-player characters with dialogue, scrollable maps, a memorable soundtrack, and a short, digestible story. I've worked on games like this before, so hopefully I don't get to caught up on the simple stuff and I can focus on making this a unique game.
