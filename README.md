Final Project: Role Playing Game

For my final project, I worked on a 2D top-down role playing game, similar to the old Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games. The purpose of this project wasn't necessarily to make a full game with a story; it really mostly turned into an effort to make a RPG engine.

Even though this isn't a final product, I really like the idea of using "crude", hand-drawn graphics. In the past I've played many independently developed RPGs that feature sketched out graphics, and I feel that those particular games have a unique charisma to them. I personally spend a lot of time doodling and sketching, and giving some life to my drawings is something that I really enjoy doing. That being said, this is a project that I would love to develop into a full-fledged experience in the future.
